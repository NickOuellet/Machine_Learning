# Machine_Learning
This is a repo that houses my assignments for Fall '21 Machine Learning (Dr. Jihun Hamm) course at Tulane University. Some examples may produce unfavorable training data (all data labeled under one class), so just re-run the data creation until a trainable set is aquired. <br/>
HW1: Linear Classification using Perceptron Learning Algorithm <br/>
HW2: Bias/Variance analysis of simple linear function attepting to fit sin(x) <br/>
HW3: Linear Regression Analysis compared to PLA and Pocket version of PLA. <br/>
HW4: Regression techniques with Regularization.<br/>
HW5: K-nearest neighbor and RBF classification on handwritten numbers 0-9.<br/>
